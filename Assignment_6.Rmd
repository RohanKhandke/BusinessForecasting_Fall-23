##From the graph we can infer that the data is not seasonal as there is no repeating pattern of peaks and valleys from 2017 to 2023. This suggests that the data is being driven by a long-term trend.


#Tests to check if series is stationary
adf.test(ts_data) #p-value is 0.7994 (> 0.05). Hence, differences is required.
kpss.test(ts_data) #p-value is 0.02 (< 0.01). Hence, differences is required.


#To check how much differences is needed
ndiffs(ts_data) #It determines the order of differencing needed to make a time series stationary.

tsdisplay(ts_data) #Used to create a series of time series plots for diagnostic purposes. These plots include the time series plot, ACF and PACF.


tsdiff1 <- diff(ts_data, differences=1) #We take first order differences as indicated by ndiffs function.

tsdisplay(tsdiff1)


#To see if more differences is needed
ndiffs(tsdiff1) #Since, the o/p is zero, it means that the time series data we provided is already stationary.
adf.test(tsdiff1) #p-value is 0.01 (< 0.05). Hence, differences is not required.
kpss.test(tsdiff1) #p-value is 0.1 (> 0.01). Hence, differences is not required.
